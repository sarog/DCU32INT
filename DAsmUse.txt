DCU32INT Disassembler Usage.

The only place, where the disassembler is used in the current version 
of the program is the

  procedure TUnit.ShowCodeBl(Ofs0,BlOfs,BlSz: Cardinal);

  where
    Ofs0 - virtual address of the block start (>0 only for procedures,
           which where linked from some .obj file; there could be near 
           jumps or conditional jumps between such procedures)
    BlOfs - Offset of the block in the unit data block
    BlSz - Size of the block.


To obtain the physical address of the block, the

  function TUnit.GetBlockMem(BlOfs,BlSz: Cardinal; var ResSz: Cardinal): Pointer;

is used. ResSz<BlSz when BlOfs+BlSz>FDataBlSize, it can happen only due to
some error.


To obtain the index of the first fixup with its Offset>=BlOfs is used the

  function TUnit.GetStartFixup(Ofs: Cardinal): integer;

Binary search is used to get the start fixup.


The next fixup index with its Offset>=Ofs after the fixup with 
the index iStart is returned by the

  function TUnit.GetNextFixup(iStart: integer; Ofs: Cardinal): integer;

Sequential search is used to get the next fixup.


Both functions return FFixupCnt, when there is no more fixups after Ofs.

The fixup information is stored in the table of 8-byte records
(see the unit FixUp)

TFixupRec = record
  OfsF: integer;{Low 3 bytes - ofs, high 1 byte - B1}
  Ndx: TNDX; {The index of the target address}
end ;


The constant

  FixOfsMask = $FFFFFF;

is used to extract the fixup Offset value from the OfsF field.


The F byte in the OfsF field can take the following values:

  fxAddr = 1; //absolute data address should be substituted
  fxJmpAddr = 2; //relative data address should be substituted 
     //(for jmp or call near instructions).
  fxDataAddr = 3; //imported data reference (from another unit)
     //this interpretation appears only in Delphi 3.0+

  fxStart20 = 3; //Start of block marker in Delhi 2.0 units
  fxEnd20 = 4;  //End of of block marker in Delhi 2.0 units
  fxStart30 = 5; //Start of block marker in Delhi 3.0+ units
  fxEnd30 = 6; //End of block marker in Delhi 3.0+ units

The typed constants 

  fxStart: Byte;
  fxEnd: Byte;

are assigned to the fxStart and fxEnd values of the current unit version.

The fxEnd flag is used only for the last block, and for all the other
blocks the block end is marked by the start of the next block.

All the fixups (fxAddr, fxJmpAddr, fxDataAddr) are 4-byte in size. 
The target address of fixup is determined as the address, corresponding 
to the fixup Ndx + the 4 byte value at the fixup Offset.

The 

  function TUnit.GetAddrStr(hDef: integer; ShowNDX: boolean): String;
    hDef - Ndx
    ShowNdx - include hDef into the result or not

can be used to get the Ndx text description, and the

  function TUnit.GetGlobalAddrDef(hDef: integer; var{out} U: TUnit): TDCURec;

can be used to get the unit, where the address is defined and 
the definition of the address.


Besides from the GetStartFixup and GetNextFixup methods, the ShowCodeBl
procedure uses as an interface to the disassembler, the following 
functions from the FixUp unit:

procedure SetFixupInfo(ACodeFixupCnt: integer; ACodeFixups: PFixupRec;
  AFixUnit: Pointer{TUnit});

This function sets the fixup information, which is used, e.g.
to ensure, that all the addresses (e.g. jump address) are fixed, or,
on the other hand, that fixed memory is not interpreted as code bytes, 
and also, to show the fixup targets when printing the decoded 
instruction (see the function ReportFixup(Fix: PFixupRec): boolean).

Now the procedure ShowCodeBl is executed for every TProcDecl, and
represents all the contents of the corresponding memory as a
sequence of instructions. When the instructions are interleaved
with some data, the correct instructions' boundaries can be shifted, and
it can be completely wrong. The only insurance, which enables to hope, 
that such a shift won't be too long, is taking into account the fixup 
information. 

Another problem is that not all the TProcDecls are really code, some of 
them are used to represent initial values of typed constants. Example:

const
  conStr:{T#2}System.AnsiString{Ofs:0x1C} = 'QWERTY';

procedure _NF_1A?{BProc:0,B0:0,Sz:10};
begin
  //raw[0x10]at 0x20
  00: ÿÿ     [FF FF               | ? EDI
  02: ÿÿ     |FF FF               | ? EDI
  04: .      |06                  | PUSH ES
  05: ..     |00 00               | ADD BYTE PTR [EAX],AL
  07: .QW    |00 51 57            | ADD BYTE PTR [ECX+87],DL
  0A: E      |45                  | INC EBP
  0B: R      |52                  | PUSH EDX
  0C: T      |54                  | PUSH ESP
  0D: Y      |59                  | POP ECX
  0E: ..     |00 00               | ADD BYTE PTR [EAX],AL
end;

One can suppose that the simple improvement to DCU32INT could be to 
take into account that some address range in the code part should be 
interpreted as a data by remembering that information somewhere in the 
TProcDecl. The problem here is that we have no information to distinguish 
the following two cases:

 CP1: PChar = 'ABCD';
 CP2: PChar = @TestProc; 

where TestProc is declared only in implementation. So, not everything 
is so simple.

The possible way to detect all the real procedures could be:
  1. Start with all the real procedures (which are named). 
    The entry point of all the procedures is at their block start.
  2. Follow the references and disassemble only those procedures, 
    which are called by some other procedures.
